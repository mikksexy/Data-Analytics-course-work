# Data Analytics course work
This is a showcase of a course work I did for TJTS4901 Database Systems and Data Analytics course in JYU in 2022.

The aim of the course was researching a topic of interest with data analysis methods. The course work started with finding an interesting dataset and coming up with research questions or hypotheses based on it. Next, a database was set up and the data was transformed and loaded into the system. In order to answer the research questions, SQL queries and visualizations were implemented in a BI analytics tool. The queries were later indexed for better performance. A dashboard was created out of the visualizations. The dashboard and the findings were later reported in a video format.
